# 🌱 ClimNode

**ClimNode** is a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** built on the **Stacks blockchain**, using **Clarity smart contracts** to transparently fund and implement local climate initiatives. ClimNode empowers communities to take action against climate change through a blockchain-governed, community-led platform that supports localized environmental projects.

---

## 🌍 Vision

ClimNode’s mission is to decentralize climate action—putting decision-making and funding power into the hands of communities and individuals who are most affected by environmental challenges. Our goal is to fund, launch, and track sustainable, local climate projects with the backing of an open and transparent governance structure.
